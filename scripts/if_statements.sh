# Given three integers (, , and ) representing the three sides of a triangle, identify whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral.

# If all three sides are equal, output EQUILATERAL.
# Otherwise, if any two sides are equal, output ISOSCELES.
# Otherwise, output SCALENE.
# Input Format

# Three integers, each on a new line.

# Constraints


# The sum of any two sides will be greater than the third.

# Output Format

# One word: either "SCALENE" or "EQUILATERAL" or "ISOSCELES" (quotation marks excluded).

# Sample Input

read y;
read z;
